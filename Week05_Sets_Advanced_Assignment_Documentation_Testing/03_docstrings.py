#----------------------------------DOCSTRINGS-----------------------------------

# A special kind of string exists in Python called a docstring.

# A docstring is a string that is the first statement in a package, module,
# class, or function.

# A docstring begins and ends with three double or single quotes.


# Example:
""" This is a docstring
you can type on multiple
lines with a docstring.
"""

# Docstrings can be used to document all aspects of your Python module:
#    -a docstring can appear at the top to give an overall view of the module.
#    -a docstring can appear inside of a function after the function header
#     and before the function code.
#    -docstrings if placed in the correct location in your code are assigned to
#    the __doc__ attribute, and can be extracted to produce documentation.


# You can view the docstring of a module by importing that module into the
# python interpreter and using the help(module_name) function

# import module_name
# help(module_name)

# see example_google.py and my_strings_google_style.py for Google Style docstrings.
# see example_numpy.py and my_strings_numpy_style.py for Numpy Style docstrings.
